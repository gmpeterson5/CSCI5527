# CSCI5527

Our directories and datasets were built using the instructions in the README of [Chris Donahue's Dance Dance Convolution Github](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/ddc).

Architecture and parameter changes are located in [CSCI5527/onset_net_gina5.py](https://github.com/gmpeterson5/CSCI5527/blob/main/onset_net_gina5.py), which is an updated copy of [Chris Donahue's ddc/learn/onset_net.py](https://github.com/chrisdonahue/ddc/blob/master/learn/onset_net.py).

Model is trained by running the notebook [CSCI5527/TrainingCustomOnsetNet-Gina1-Copy1.py](https://github.com/gmpeterson5/CSCI5527/blob/main/TrainingCustomOnsetNet-Gina1-Copy1.py).
